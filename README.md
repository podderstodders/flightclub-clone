Project Title: Flightclub Clone

Description:
This project is a reimplementation of the Flightclub website, aimed at replicating its design and functionality for educational purposes. Flightclub is a renowned platform known for its sleek design and comprehensive information on sneakers. This reclone serves as a learning exercise to understand modern web development techniques and user interface design principles by mimicking a real-world application.

Notes: 
The most interesting part of this implementation is the search bar. 

I was able to hide certain sibling elements, as well as expand certain elements, when the input element is focused.
